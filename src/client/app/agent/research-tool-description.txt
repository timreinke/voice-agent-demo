This tool allows you to perform web research to gather comprehensive information on topics requested by the user.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- When the user asks you to research a specific topic, company, person, or concept
- When the user wants current information about recent events, trends, or developments
- When the user asks questions that require factual information from external sources
- When the user needs data, statistics, or expert opinions on a subject
- When the user wants to verify claims or get multiple perspectives on a topic
- When the user asks "look up", "research", "find information about", "what's the latest on", etc.

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS TOOL:
- For general knowledge questions you can answer from your training data
- When the user is asking about the document content or personal opinions
- For simple factual questions with well-established answers
- When the user explicitly says they don't want web research

HOW TO USE THE TOOL:
The tool accepts two parameters:
1. "query" (required): What to research
2. "context" (optional): Additional context to guide the research

The tool will:
1. Create a research source that appears in the user's source panel
2. Perform web searches to gather comprehensive information
3. Return structured findings including sources, summary, and key insights
4. Update the research source with the results

QUERY FORMATTING GUIDELINES:

1. Be specific and focused:
   - Instead of: "AI"
   - Use: "Latest developments in generative AI for healthcare applications"

2. Include relevant timeframes when needed:
   - "Electric vehicle sales growth in 2024"
   - "Recent changes to privacy regulations"

3. Specify the type of information needed:
   - "Benefits and risks of remote work policies"
   - "Market analysis of sustainable energy companies"

4. Use natural language that would work well in web searches:

   - "Best practices for employee retention in tech startups"

CONTEXT PARAMETER USAGE:

Use the context parameter to provide additional guidance:
- "Focus on environmental and economic impacts"
- "Include both pros and cons"
- "Emphasis on recent developments since 2023"
- "Looking for practical implementation examples"
