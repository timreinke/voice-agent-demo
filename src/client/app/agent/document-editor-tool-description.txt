This tool allows you to request changes to the user's document through a specialized document-editing agent.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- When the user asks you to modify, edit, or update their document
- When the user wants to add, remove, or reorganize content in the document
- When the user requests formatting changes (headers, lists, emphasis, etc.)
- When the user asks for content improvements (clarity, grammar, style)
- When the user wants to expand or elaborate on existing content
- When the user asks to summarize or condense parts of the document

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS TOOL:
- For simple questions about the document content (just answer directly)
- When the user is discussing topics unrelated to document editing
- For general conversation that doesn't involve document changes

HOW TO USE THE TOOL:
The tool accepts a single parameter: "instructions"

The instructions should be a clear, concise summary that includes:
1. The specific change requested by the user
2. Any relevant context from the conversation
3. Any constraints or preferences mentioned by the user

INSTRUCTION FORMATTING GUIDELINES:

1. Be specific about what needs to be changed:
   - Instead of: "Make it better"
   - Use: "Improve clarity by breaking long sentences and adding transition words"

2. Include location context when relevant:
   - "In the introduction section, add a brief overview of..."
   - "Replace the third paragraph with..."
   - "At the end of the document, append..."

3. Preserve user preferences:
   - If they want formal tone: "Rewrite in a more formal, professional tone"
   - If they want brevity: "Condense this section to 2-3 sentences"
   - If they specify a style: "Format as a numbered list with brief explanations"

4. Include multiple related changes in one instruction:
   - "Add a conclusion paragraph summarizing the main points, and format all headers as H2"

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INSTRUCTIONS:

User: "Can you make the introduction more engaging?"
Instructions: "Rewrite the introduction to be more engaging by adding a compelling hook, using active voice, and creating a clearer connection to the reader's interests"

User: "Add a section about best practices"
Instructions: "Add a new section titled 'Best Practices' after the current content, including 5-7 actionable recommendations with brief explanations for each"

User: "The document is too wordy"
Instructions: "Reduce wordiness throughout the document by eliminating redundant phrases, combining related sentences, and using more concise language while preserving all key information"

User: "Fix the grammar and make it flow better"
Instructions: "Correct all grammar errors and improve flow by adding transition phrases between paragraphs, varying sentence structure, and ensuring logical progression of ideas"

User: "Can you reorganize this to be clearer?"
Instructions: "Reorganize the document for better clarity by grouping related topics together, adding clear section headers, and ensuring each section flows logically to the next"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The document-editor agent will receive the current document content automatically
- You don't need to include the document content in your instructions
- Focus on clearly communicating WHAT needs to be changed and HOW
- If the user's request is vague, infer reasonable improvements based on common document editing practices
- Always maintain the document's core message and purpose unless explicitly asked to change it
- Before running this tool, tell the user you will be running it. It can take some time, and you should let them know
