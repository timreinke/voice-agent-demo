This tool allows you to request changes to the user's document through a specialized document-editing agent.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- When the user asks you to modify, edit, or update their document
- When the user wants to add, remove, or reorganize content in the document
- When the user asks you to write something, they are probably asking to edit the document
- When the user requests formatting changes (headers, lists, emphasis, etc.)
- When the user asks for content improvements (clarity, grammar, style)
- When the user wants to expand or elaborate on existing content
- When the user asks to summarize or condense parts of the document

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS TOOL:
- For simple questions about the document content (just answer directly)
- When the user is discussing topics unrelated to document editing
- For general conversation that doesn't involve document changes

HOW TO USE THE TOOL:
The tool accepts a single parameter: "instructions"

The instructions should include:
1. Recent conversation context, summarized to the appropriate level of detail. The summary should only include information that is likely to relate to the user's query. Often user edit requests are independent of previous edits, so it is ok for the context to be empty.
2. The user's message verbatim
3. Any specific constraints or preferences mentioned by the user

The user's current selection is automatically provided to the document editor tool, so you don't need to worry about selection context.

INSTRUCTION FORMATTING GUIDELINES:

1. Be specific about what needs to be changed:
   - Instead of: "Make it better"
   - Use: "Improve clarity by breaking long sentences and adding transition words"

2. Include location context when relevant:
   - "In the introduction section, add a brief overview of..."
   - "Replace the third paragraph with..."
   - "At the end of the document, append..."

3. Preserve user preferences:
   - If they want formal tone: "Rewrite in a more formal, professional tone"
   - If they want brevity: "Condense this section to 2-3 sentences"
   - If they specify a style: "Format as a numbered list with brief explanations"

4. Include multiple related changes in one instruction:
   - "Add a conclusion paragraph summarizing the main points, and format all headers as H2"

5. User selection is implicit
   - If the user asks to "reword this line" or "translate this" or similar phrases that imply they are referring to something specific,
     then your instructions should allow the tool to flexibly decide what to edit.

EXAMPLES OF GOOD INSTRUCTIONS:

<example>
<user>Can you make the introduction more engaging?</user>
<edit-request>
context: 
user request: Can you make the introduction more engaging?
</edit-request>
</example>

<example>
<user>Add a section about best practices</user>
<edit-request>
context: 
user request: Add a section about best practices
</edit-request>
</example>

<example>
<user>The document is too wordy</user>
<edit-request>
context: 
user request: The document is too wordy
</edit-request>
</example>

<example>
<user>Fix the grammar and make it flow better</user>
<edit-request>
context: 
user request: Fix the grammar and make it flow better
</edit-request>
</example>

<example>
<user>Can you reorganize this to be clearer?</user>
<edit-request>
context: User previously asked to add more technical details to the document
user request: Can you reorganize this to be clearer?
</edit-request>
</example>

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The document-editor agent will receive the current document content and user selection automatically
- You don't need to include the document content or selection details in your instructions
- Always include the user's message verbatim to give the document editor full context
- Include relevant conversation context only if it directly relates to the current request
- Focus on clearly communicating WHAT needs to be changed and HOW
- If the user's request is vague, infer reasonable improvements based on common document editing practices
- Always maintain the document's core message and purpose unless explicitly asked to change it
- Before running this tool, tell the user you will be running it. It can take some time, and you should let them know
