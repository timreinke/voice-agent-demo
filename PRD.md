# Product Requirements Document: Voice-Driven Document Drafting Interface

## Executive Summary

A voice-driven document drafting application that enables business professionals, students, and technical writers to create reports and internal communications through natural conversation with AI agents. Users speak their requirements while the system orchestrates specialized agents to research, draft, and refine documents in real-time.

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform document creation from typing-based workflows to conversational experiences where users describe what they need and AI agents handle the research, writing, and editing tasks.

### Target Users
- **Business Professionals**: Creating reports, memos, and internal communications
- **Students**: Drafting academic papers and research documents  
- **Technical Writers**: Producing documentation and technical content
- **Internal Communications Teams**: Weekly newsletters, broadcast messages for organizational alignment

### Core Value Proposition
- Faster document creation through voice interaction
- Automated research and fact-gathering
- Intelligent content organization and editing
- Seamless integration of multiple information sources

## User Experience

### Interface Layout
- **Left Panel (Input Sources)**
  - Voice input controls with real-time transcription
  - URL input for web page sources
  - Text snippet input area
  - Source conflict notifications
  - Input annotations/notes
  
- **Right Panel (Document Canvas)**
  - Live HTML document preview
  - Real-time updates as agents work
  - Document version indicator
  - Basic document controls (New, Save)

- **Status Bar**
  - Agent activity indicators
  - Task progress tracking
  - System status

### Primary Workflow
1. User speaks requirements into the system
2. Voice agent interprets intent and triggers appropriate tools
3. Research agents gather information from provided URLs or web searches
4. Editor agent drafts/revises document based on research and user guidance
5. User reviews output and provides additional voice instructions
6. Iterative refinement until document meets requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Voice Interaction
- **Real-time Transcription**: Continuous voice capture and processing
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Interpret user intent from conversational input
- **Tool Invocation**: Voice agent translates requests into tool calls
- **Feedback Loop**: System can ask clarifying questions via voice

### Input Management
- **Web Page Processing**: Extract and summarize content from URLs
- **Text Snippets**: Accept pasted text for inclusion in research
- **Conflict Resolution**: Surface conflicting information for user decision
- **Input Annotation**: Add notes/context to inputs via voice commands

### Agent Architecture

#### Coordinator Agent (Voice Agent)
- Primary interface for voice interactions
- Interprets user intent
- Orchestrates other agents via tool calls
- Manages conversation flow

#### Research Agent  
- Analyzes input sources (URLs, snippets)
- Performs web searches using OpenAI web_search tool
- Extracts key information
- Identifies conflicts or gaps

#### Document Editor Agent
- Takes research findings and user guidance
- Produces clean, semantic HTML
- Maintains document structure and flow
- Incorporates citations for sources

### Document Management
- **Version Control**: Store multiple document versions
- **Format**: HTML-only output with semantic markup
- **Display**: Render HTML directly in canvas
- **Length**: Support documents up to ~10 pages

### Task Management
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Support 1-3 simultaneous operations
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback and updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for ongoing tasks
- **Task Types**:
  - URL analysis
  - Web search research  
  - Document editing
  - Input processing

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Hono with JSX components
- **State Management**: Local state with potential migration to Durable Objects
- **Voice Processing**: Web Speech API or similar for real-time transcription
- **UI Updates**: Real-time document canvas updates

### Backend  
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Agent Framework**: OpenAI Agents SDK
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for agent interactions
- **Storage**: TBD (local storage initially, Durable Objects for persistence)

### Agent Implementation
- **Models**: GPT-4o-mini for efficiency
- **Tools**: 
  - Web search (OpenAI native)
  - Document editing
  - Input manipulation
  - Source analysis
- **Context Passing**: Maintain conversation history and document state

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Voice transcription latency < 500ms
- Agent response time < 3 seconds
- Document updates render in real-time
- Support concurrent agent operations

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Conversation recovery after interruptions
- Input validation and error messaging

### Scalability
- Initial prototype for single-user sessions
- Architecture allows future multi-user support
- Modular agent system for extensibility

## Success Metrics

### User Efficiency
- Time to create first draft reduced by 50% vs traditional methods
- Number of voice interactions to complete document
- User satisfaction with output quality

### System Performance
- Agent task completion rate
- Average response time
- Transcription accuracy

### Content Quality
- Proper citation inclusion rate
- Document structure adherence
- Grammar and clarity scores

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Features
- PDF and other document format support
- File upload capabilities
- Custom agent definitions
- Collaboration features

### Phase 3 Features  
- Multi-modal inputs (images, diagrams)
- Advanced formatting options
- Template library
- Export to various formats

## Implementation Priorities

### MVP (Phase 1)
1. Voice transcription and basic agent interaction
2. URL input and web page analysis
3. Document editor agent with HTML output
4. Simple version storage
5. Task status indicators

### Post-MVP
1. Enhanced research capabilities
2. Conflict resolution UI
3. Input annotation system
4. Performance optimizations
5. Persistent storage solution

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- HTML-only document format
- OpenAI API dependencies
- Cloudflare Workers limitations
- Browser compatibility requirements

### Assumptions
- Users have stable internet connection
- Microphone access available
- English language initially
- Desktop/laptop usage (not mobile-first)
